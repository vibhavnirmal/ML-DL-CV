### Data

The data set contains the following information:

| Variable    | Description                                                          |
|:------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Survived    | Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)                                           |
| Pclass      | Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)                             |
| Name        | String                                                               |
