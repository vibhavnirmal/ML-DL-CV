This repository provides a basic template for implementing and understanding various machine learning algorithms. It's designed to be accessible to beginners like myself and can be easily adapted to solve a wide range of problems with minimal modifications.

Important: While the template aims for simplicity, some basic changes specific to your chosen dataset will be necessary. An example of such modifications is provided in the [code](https://github.com/vibhavnirmal/MachineLearningPrograms/tree/master/template "ML template")
